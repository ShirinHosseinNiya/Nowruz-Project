“CHIHIRO,” the third track on HIT ME HARD AND SOFT sees Billie feeling unseen and misunderstood as she searches for spiritual and physical reconnection with the world. The title is a reference to the 荻野千尋 (Chihiro “Sen” Ogino), of Spirited Away – an Oscar-winning film from スタジオジブリ (Studio Ghibli) released in 2001 which follows a girl who “learned to face her fears by developing a heightened understanding and appreciation of life.”
