“BITTERSUITE” is the ninth track of Billie Eilish’s third studio album HIT ME HARD AND SOFT. The title is a play on the world “bittersweet,“ converting the suffix “sweet” into the homophonic “suite”. Seeming as if it’s a minor change, the conversion of “sweet” compels the idea that Eilish has been left bitter in a hotel suite on her own with no tinge of pleasure. With the song being sectioned into parts, this is reminiscent of a musical suite, which features a group of self-contained instrumental movements of varying character, usually in the same key, with Part I serving as the prelude and the Spoken part serving as the postlude.
