“LUNCH” is one of Billie’s boldest tracks to date. Likening lesbian sex to an afternoon meal, Billie discusses both her sexual prowess and desire to be with an unnamed woman – the latter theme being one of many defining the album. It is second track from Billie Eilish’s third studio album, HIT ME HARD AND SOFT. It explores themes of queerness, identity, confidence, and questioning, making it simultaneously one of Eilish’s more explicit and undertoned songs. Eilish discussed the song in an interview with Rolling Stone, where she discussed how the song helped her understand her queer identity better.
