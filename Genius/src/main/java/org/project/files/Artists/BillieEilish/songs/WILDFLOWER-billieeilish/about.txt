“WILDFLOWER” is the fifth track from Billie Eilish’s third studio LP HIT ME HARD AND SOFT. It recounts Eilish’s experience comforting a girl after a difficult breakup, then having a romantic relationship with the person that the girl broke up with. The title of the song may be to an allusion to Wildflower Cases, a brand founded by Devon Carlson, who had previously dated Eilish’s now ex-boyfriend, Jesse Rutherford, frontman of alternative rock band the Neighbourhood. Billie seems to have befriended Devon Lee Carlson and was seen out with her in 2023.
