On June 7, 2022, just twelve days after stating that she was “just now starting to think about the next [album]” on The Ellen Show, Eilish performed an unreleased song at her Happier Than Ever: The World Tour show in Manchester, rumored to be on her third studio album. Over a month later, on July 21st, Eilish surprise-released “TV” alongside another song titled “The 30th.”

In ‘TV’ by Billie Eilish, the theme of neglect in relationships is poignantly explored, revealing how individuals can become so engrossed in their personal escapism and societal distractions that they unintentionally isolate themselves from meaningful connections and self-awareness.
